You are an information extraction model.

Your task is to extract structured vulnerability information from the TEXT REPORT provided above.



**SECTION A — OPENVAS REPORTS** 
For reports generated by OpenVAS:
1. For each "NVT" is a block of vulnerability, extract a JSON object using the fields above.
2. Use "NVT" field as "Name".
3. Use "Summary" field as "description". 
4. Use "Vulnerability Detection Result" field as "detection_result".
5. Use "Vulnerability Detection Method" field as "detection_method".
6. Use "Product Detection Result" field as "product_detection_result".
7. Use "Impact" field as "impact".
8. Use "Solution" field as "solution".
9. Use "Vulnerability insight" field as "insight".
10. Use "Product Detection Result" field as "product_detection_result".
11. Use "CVSS" field as unique "cvss".
12. Get "port" and "protocol": Extract from above the CVSS.
13. Use "References" field as "references".
14. plugin is null. 
15. "severity" only use if found in report like LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL, otherwise LOG.
16. Use "Log Method" field as "log_method".

**SECTION B — TENABLE WAS REPORTS**  
For reports generated by Tenable WAS:
1. For each "Vulnerability" is a block of vulnerability, extract a JSON object using the fields above.
2. Use "Vulnerability" field as "Name".
3. Use "Description" field as "description".  
4. Use "Solution" field as "solution".
5. Use "References Information" field as "references".
6. Use "Plugin Detail" field as "plugin".
7. For "detection_result" is null.
8. For "detection_method" is null.
9. For "impact" is null.
10. For "insight" is null.
11. For "product_detection_result" is null.
12. For "log_method" is null.

**GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Extract every occurrence of a vulnerability, even if the name is repeated. Do not group, merge, or skip any block.
2. Extract all complete sentences from the following text. A sentence ends with a period e.g. (.), question mark (?), or exclamation mark (!) . Return them as a numbered list in the order they appear.

Return the output in valid JSON format using exactly these fields. Your response MUST be only a valid JSON array, with no text, explanation, or formatting before or after the JSON. Do not include any commentary, markdown, or extra text—just the JSON array:
