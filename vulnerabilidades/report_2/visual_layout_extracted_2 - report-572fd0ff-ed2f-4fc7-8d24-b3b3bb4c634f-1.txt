 Summary 
 The Mailserver on this host answers to VRFY and/or EXPN requests. 
 
 Vulnerability Detection Result 
 'VRFY root' produces the following answer: 252 2.0.0 root 
 
 Solution 
 Solution type: Workaround 
 Disable VRFY and/or EXPN on your Mailserver. 
 For postx add 'disable_vrfy_command=yes' in 'main.cf'. 
 For Sendmail add the option 'O PrivacyOptions=goaway'. 
 It is suggested that, if you really want to publish this type of information, you use a mechanism
 that legitimate users actually know about, such as Finger or HTTP. 
 Vulnerability Insight 
 VRFY and EXPN ask the server for information about an address. They are inherently unusable
 through rewalls, gateways, mail exchangers for part-time hosts, etc.

 Vulnerability Detection Result 
 The Hostname/IP "localhost" was used to access the remote host. 
 Generic web application scanning is disabled for this host via the "Enable gener

 ->he scan config in use. 
 Requests to this service are done via HTTP/1.1. 
 This service seems to be NOT able to host PHP scripts. 
 This service seems to be NOT able to host ASP scripts. 
 The User-Agent "Mozilla/5.0 [en] (X11, U; OpenVAS-VT 9.0.3)" was used to access
 ->the remote host. 
 Historic /scripts and /cgi-bin are not added to the directories used for CGI sca
 ->nning. You can enable this again with the "Add historic /scripts and /cgi-bin
 ->to directories for CGI scanning" option within the "Global variable settings"
 ->of the scan config in use. 
 The following directories were used for CGI scanning: 
 https://localhost/ 
 While this is not, in and of itself, a bug, you should manually inspect these di
 ->rectories to ensure that they are in compliance with company security standard
 ->s 
 The following directories were excluded from CGI scanning because the "Regex pat
 ->tern to exclude directories from CGI scanning" setting of the NVT "Global vari
 ->able settings" (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.12288) for this scan was: "/(index\

 Summary 
 This routine reports all SSL/TLS cipher suites accepted by a service.
 As the NVT 'SSL/TLS: Check Supported Cipher Suites' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.900234)
 might run into a timeout the actual reporting of all accepted cipher suites takes place in this
 NVT instead. The script preference 'Report timeout' allows you to congure if such an timeout
 is reported.

 NVT: wapiti (NASL wrapper) 
 
 Summary 
 This plugin uses wapiti to nd web security issues. 
 Make sure to have wapiti 2.x as wapiti 1.x is not supported. 
 See the preferences section for wapiti options. 
 Note that the scanner is using limited set of wapiti options. Therefore, for more complete web
 assessment, you should use standalone wapiti tool for deeper/customized checks.
 Note: The plugin needs the 'wapiti' binary found within the PATH of the user running the scanner
 and needs to be executable for this user. The existence of this binary is checked and reported
 separately within 'Availability of scanner helper tools' (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.810000).
 Vulnerability Detection Result 
 The wapiti report filename is empty. That could mean that a wrong version of wap
 ->iti is used or tmp dir is not accessible. Make sure to have wapiti 2.x as wapi
 ->ti 1.x is not supported. 
 In short: Check the installation of wapiti and the scanner.
