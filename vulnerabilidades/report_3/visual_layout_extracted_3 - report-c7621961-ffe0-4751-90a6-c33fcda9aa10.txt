 Solution 
 Solution type: Workaround 
 Disable VRFY and/or EXPN on your Mailserver. 
 For postx add 'disable_vrfy_command=yes' in 'main.cf'. 
 For Sendmail add the option 'O PrivacyOptions=goaway'. 
 It is suggested that, if you really want to publish this type of information, you use a mechanism
 that legitimate users actually know about, such as Finger or HTTP. 
 Vulnerability Insight 
 VRFY and EXPN ask the server for information about an address. They are inherently unusable
 through rewalls, gateways, mail exchangers for part-time hosts, etc.
